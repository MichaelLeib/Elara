      "message": "The error occurs due to your code having arrays for the \"model\" and \"details\" properties, which are not valid React components. The react-dom_client library is responsible for rendering those props as child components in the dom. You need to modify your code to use proper component types and keys that match the intended structure of your data.\n\nHere's an example of how you could do this:\n\n```javascript\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport axios from 'axios';\n\nconst [model, setModel] = useState();\nconst [details, setDetails] = useState(null);\nconst [status, setStatus] = useState('');\nconst [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);\n\n// Get the latest model data from API\nfunction fetchModels() {\n  axios.get('/models')\n    .then((res) => {\n      setModel(res.data);\n    })\n    .catch(() => {\n      // handle errors\n    });\n}\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n  fetchModels();\n}, []);\n\n// Get details about a specific model by its ID or name\nfunction getDetails(idOrName) {\n  const id = parseInt(idOrName);\n  if (!id || typeof id !== 'number') return;\n  \n  // Load details for the specified model\n  axios.get(`/models/${id}/details`)\n    .then((res) => {\n      setDetails(res.data);\n    })\n    .catch(() => {\n      // handle errors\n    });\n}\n\n// Render models and details as UI components\nfunction renderModels() {\n  const modelNames = Object.keys(model).sort();\n  return modelNames.map((name) => (\n    <div key={name}>\n      <h3>Model: {name}</h3>\n      {loading ? null : <p>Fetching details...</p>}\n      {details && <pre>{JSON.stringify(model[name], null, 2)}</pre>}\n    </div>\n  ));\n}\n\nreturn (\n  <>\n    {status === 'loading' ? null : <div>Loading models and details...</div>}\n    {renderModels()}\n  </>\n);\n```\n\nIn this example, we're using a similar approach to fetching the model data. We first check if there is an existing API response for the requested ID or name. If not, we return the loading state and render our own UI components. Once the API request has completed successfully, we'll use the `model` prop as the value of the appropriate child component (`<div>` or `<h3>`) based on the passed props. For example:\n\n```html\n<div key=\"name\" onClick={() => getDetails(idOrName)}>\n  <p>Model: {model[idOrName]}</p>\n</div>\n```\n\nIn this case, we're using a `click` event to call the `getDetails()` function for each `idOrName`. The `key` attribute is used as a unique identifier to group the child components together.",
